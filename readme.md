# Tetriling reassembly problem solver

Fast and quite accurate solution for the tetriling reassembly problem.

1000x1000 usually solves in less than 30 seconds for any density, with accuracy almost always above 90%

Run the project by doing:

python performance_std.py

You can change the size of the board and density in the performance_std.py as well.
With larger boards, the visualisation might take a long time, so comment it out at the bottom of performance_std.py to speed things up.
